# Product Price Estimator

**Product Price Estimator** is a web-based tool designed to help individuals and small businesses quickly estimate the selling price for a product based on its attributesâ€”without needing deep analytics or pricing expertise.

##  How It Works
Built with Flask, the application allows users to:
1. Fill in product parameters (e.g., cost, category, markup, etc.).
2. Submit the form to trigger Python logic in `app.py`.
3. Instantly receive an estimated price, which can be customized by adjusting parameters in `src/`.

##  Why Use It?
- **Fast & Lightweight**: Minimal setup, with core logic streamlined in Flask.
- **Easy to Extend**: Add features like cost breakdowns, competitor pricing, or dynamic markups.
- **Ideal for MVPs**: A strong proof-of-concept for startups or freelancers looking to launch quick pricing tools.

##  Technologies Used
- **Python + Flask** for backend logic
- **HTML/CSS** for the frontend input form
- **Modular structure** under `src/` for clean, maintainable code
